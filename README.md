# Oracle Cleanup
When uninstalling Retail Pro 9, not all of the Oracle library stuff is uninstalled properly making reinstallation of RP9 a pain (this was several years ago, I think newer versions are better). This old Delphi project attempts to clean it up, but never really worked consistently. It should probably be turned into a PowerShell script.
